- If you would like to modify an image, copy the name "LanSchool_Protecter" from the original 
  image and paste the new image and delete the old image. Make sure you have AutoHotkey installed
  for this to work.

- The image fullscreens on the teacher's screen when a teacher connects. This way, it protects what your doing and
  the teacher can't see your screen. [Note for your school district: this is not modifying anything
  that bypasses websites or disrupting learning and education. This is for simple privacy only.]
